# Overview of Ramo Computer
Ramo Computer is a software that allows anyone – from consumers to enterprise-grade operators – to commit and consume hardware resources on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) via the Ramo network. The tool acts as an aggregator for the supply (and demand) of DePIN-mitigated cloud services.

DePIN refers to a system where physical infrastructure, such as data storage, computing power, or networking, is operated and coordinated in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. The approach distributes control and management across a network of participants rather than one central authority and enhances scalability and resilience while reducing costs.

With Ramo Computer, activities like providing and consuming storage on the Filecoin network – which previously required large-scale operations managed by a team of skilled engineers – can now run on consumer-grade hardware by anyone. This democratizes access to Filecoin and eventually other DePINs. 

The community working on Ramo Computer believes that reducing the barriers to participate in decentralized networks as providers is key to catalyzing the transition away from proprietary cloud infrastructure and tooling towards open compute protocols. Ramo Computer is a major milestone in the efforts to reduce complexity of participating and level the playing field to allow a growing number of open compute protocols to run on a more open, performant, scalable network of infrastructure providers.

# Using Ramo Computer
Ramo Computer can be used in a datacenter context and running on enterprise-grade hardware as well as on most laptops. The users' ability to commit resources depends on the resources available in their specific setup. Visit ramo.computer to download the software and follow the instructions on how to configure and setup the tool on your machine. In future releases, more features will be added. Among other things, we will be adding new commands, a UI and allow users to commit more types of hardware resources (e.g., hard drives for storage, circuits for computational workloads and networking equipment to move data). The ultimate vision for Ramo Computer is to empower its users to both commit and consume the networked resources via a global marketplace.

# Contributing to Ramo Computer
Anyone can start using v0.1 of Ramo Computer. We appreciate general comments, feature requests and bugs. Please share your feedback by filing issues in this repository. We will be releasing new versions of Ramo Computer on a rolling basis and incorporate user feedback. We will be logging changes alongside each release.
